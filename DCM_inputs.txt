DCM Calculations
Normalized Net Income = Net Income last 5 years / 5
Normalized Net Capital Expenditures = (Net Capital Expenditures last 5 years / EBIT last 5 years) * EBIT current year
Normalized Working Capital Change = (Total Non-Cash Working Capital current year / Revenue current year) * (Revenue current year - Revenue last year)
Normalized Net Debt Issued = (Book Vakue of Debt current year / (Book Value of Debt current year + Book Value of Equity current year)) * (Normalized Net Capital Expenditures + Normalized Working Capital Change)
Non-Cash ROE = Normalized Net Income / (Book Value of Equity prior year - Cash & Marketable Securities prior year)
Equity Reinvestment Rate = (Normalized Net Capital Expenditure + Normalized Net Working Capital - Normalized Net Debt Issued) / (Net Income current year - Interest Income from Cash & Marketable Securities current year)
Levered Beta = Unlevered Beta of the sector(1 + (1 - Tax Rate) * (Debt / Equity))
Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
Growth Rate in Net Income = Non Cash Roe * Equity Reinvestment Rate


DCF Calculations (Iterate over 5 Years)
**Satrt with Net Income w/o interest income from cas & marketable securities for the current year

For year in range(1, 6):
Net Income(year) = Net Income (year - 1) * Expected Growth Rate
Free Cash Flow to Equity = Net Income(year) * (1 - Equity Reinvestment Rate)
Cumulative Cost of Equity(year) = (1 + Cost of Equity)**year
Present Value of Free Cash Flow to Equity(year) = Net Income(year) / Cumulative Cost of Equity(year)
Total Present Value of Free Cash Flows to Equity = Sum of Present Value of Free Cash Flows to Equity
Terminal Equity Value = (PV of Free Cash Flow to Equity[-1] * ( 1 + Growth Rate for Stable Period) * (1 - Equity Reinvestment Rate in Stable Period)) / (Cost of Equity in Satable Period - Growth Rate in Stable Period)
Present Value of Terminal Value = (Terminal Equity Value / Cumulative Cost of Equity[-1])
Present Value of Equity in Operating Assets = Total Present Value of Free Cash Flows to Equity + Present Value of Terminal Value
Present Value of Equity in Firm = Present Value of Equity in Operating Assets + Cash & Marketable Securities current year
Present Value of Equity per share = Present Value of Equity in Firm / Number of Shares Outstanding
Margin of Safety = Present Value of Equity per Share - Market Price per Share
Per Cent Margin of Safety = (Present Value of Share / Market Price per share) -1
Free Cash Flow to Equity Yield = Free Cash Flow to Equity[0] / Enterprise Value
Value Creation = Non-Cash ROE - Cost of Equity (positive is a value creator; negative is a value destroyer)
